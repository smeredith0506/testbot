0.7.8

Fix test job bug that caused multiple jobs to use the same TEST_ENV_NUMBER.

This caused multiple processes to use the same databases, etc.

If you're seeing database deadlocks in tests, this will probably fix that.

0.7.7

Exit when file syncing fails so that you don't run tests for a version of the
code you did not expect.

0.7.5

Fixed bug where a runner updating without a result would fail.

Also dropping official support for 1.8 as it's such a hassle to maintain.

0.7.3

Increased time between updates to avoid timeouts. Allow timeout when posting
incremental build results (but not when posting the final results).

Should make testbot more stable for some people.

0.7.2

Increased timeout on http requests to the server to 10 seconds.

0.7.1

Fixed a bug introduced in 0.7.0. The TEST_INSTANCES env-variable are now
present again when running before_run scripts.

0.7.0

Added per project rvm support. Using this you can run testbot using system ruby
while being able to run test processes using the project rvm environment. This
is also useful if you have several projects with different rvm rubies and gemsets.

0.6.9

Removed dependency on macaddr as that does not work on some platforms.

0.6.8

Fixed broken gem lookup in ruby 1.9.

0.6.6

The runner will now run config/testbot/before_run.rb if it exists.

Replaced the old process code with the posix-spawn gem's methods. This fixed
process shutdown in my current setup. Hopefully more stable overall.

The requester will now request that the build is stopped when exiting early (like when killed),
and not only on ctrl+c (SIGINT).

Most of this was based on a fork by https://github.com/Skalar.

0.6.5

Fixed test unit require path so that it works with ruby 1.9.

0.6.4

Fixed bug with running test unit tests that caused errors like '/bin/ruby:1: Invalid char `\317' in expression`'.

Now handling errors creating builds.

Returning 503 and reporting that there are no runners when that is the case.

0.6.3

Results are now shown as they happen. It takes care not to break escape codes used for
coloring output (only tested with rspec, add a script/spec file containing "rspec --tty $@").

Also, you can add a "logging: true" option to testbot.yml to see when files are synced, etc.

0.6.2

Fixed "invalid byte sequence in UTF-8" errors cased by test output in some cases.

0.6.1

Fixed CPU core check for OSX Lion.

Updated sinatra requirement so that it's a bit less strict
(https://github.com/joakimk/testbot/pull/41).

0.6.0

Fixed bug that caused the runner to crash and block the server after checking for jobs (issue #34).

Merged in https://github.com/joakimk/testbot/pull/33 (Bugfix: Run rake task testbot:before_run with bundler if present).

0.5.9

When you hit ctrl+c all related test jobs will be stopped (within about 5 seconds). You can
now exit, change code and re-run much faster than before.

It does not stop before_run or code fetch. But no tests will be run after
those complete when the build is stopped.

0.5.8

Now only running tests from one build on a runner at a time.

This is mostly usability. Testbot should behave like when you're running your tests locally.

0.5.7

Added @meeiw's patch to support ERB in config. Added test result summarization for RSpec and Cucumber.

0.5.6

Removed CPU usage check before running jobs (issue #25).

0.5.5

Added RSpec2 support. Thanks to Bryan Helmkamp, https://github.com/brynary.

0.5.4

Fixed some typos that caused the ruby interpreter to always be "ruby".

0.5.3

Added support for rubygems-test and http://gem-testers.org.

0.5.1

Fixed a bug that caused exit status to be 1 even if the test run is successful.

0.5.0

Made the status page load faster but check less often.

0.4.9

There is now a very basic status page at http://testbot_server:2288/status.

0.4.8

Removed all remaining native dependencies to make testbot simpler to install.

0.4.7

Refactored the code into modules with one directory for each. No longer dependent on mongel, now using webrick.

0.4.6

Fixed a bug that caused auto_update not to check for an update after a job had been run.

0.4.5

Made auto_update a bit more reliable.

0.4.4

Changed to using the deamons gem. Seems to fix some problems with old processes
not closing down when using auto_update.

0.4.2

Added support for quick deploys when developing testbot.

0.4.0

Fixed RSpec 2 compability issue.

0.3.9

Added support for running tests with bundler exec.

0.3.8

Testbot now uses exit code to determine if the test run has failed.

0.3.7

The runner now checks right away for another job if it got one last time around.

0.3.6

Added Rails 2 generator support.

0.3.5

Fixed ssh_tunnel bug when using a custom user.

0.3.4

Bundler support. Testbot now runs "bundle" before "testbot:before_run" if you
have "bundle" in path and have a "Gemfile" in the project so that the
rails environment can load.

0.3.3

Fixed loading issue in rails 2, testbot depended on having rails installed as a gem.

0.3.0

Made testbot into a gem. Simplified the design. Added a CLI. Removed git support.

0.2.3

Added JRuby support.

0.2.2

Replaced runtime optimization code with a simpler file size based method.

0.2.1

Added support for Test:Unit and multiple projects.

0.2.0

Added "ssh_tunnel" so that you don't have to be able to access the http server directly.

0.1.9

The server can now handle if a runner is shutdown in the middle of a test run (it will give the
job to another runner).

0.1.8

Added cucumber support and failure detection to the client. Added docs. Added code that uses
historic test runtimes to reduce test runtime (in theory).

0.1.7

Added a basic client so that testbot can be installed as a rails plugin. 'rake testbot:spec'.

0.1.6

Now only fetching the code once, and only keeping one copy of it. Less overhead.

0.1.5

Added "/runners/total_instances" to be able to balance requesters by knowing how many instances
there are in total.

0.1.4

Added support for fetching the latest version from git instead of rsync when doing a test run.

0.1.3

Added "/runners/available" to see how many runners are available.

0.1.2

Added cucumber support.

0.1.1

Added a CPU usage check to make sure that the runner does not start a job when the computer is busy.

0.1

Added hostname and STDERR to runner results.
